Hummingbird-Arduino-Library
===========================

The Arduino library for writing Hummingbird Duo Arduino Programs. Learn more about the library from the Hummingbird Arduino API Description, or visit the Duo's Arduino tutorial at: http://www.hummingbirdkit.com/learning/arduino-programming

The Hummingbird folder contains the library and example files. Hummingbird.zip is a zipped version of the library.

For the Hummingbird Duo to function properly in the Arduino environment, the board type also needs to be added. This is contained in a separate Github repo, at: https://github.com/BirdBrainTechnologies/Hummingbird-Arduino-Hardware-Description

A simple way to install everything by running a single program can be found at: http://www.hummingbirdkit.com/learning/setting-arduino-environment-hummingbird-duo
