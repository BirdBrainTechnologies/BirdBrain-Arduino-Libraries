Hummingbird-Arduino-Library
===========================

The Arduino library for writing Hummingbird Duo Arduino Programs. Learn more about the library from the Hummingbird Arduino API Description, or visit the Duo's Arduino tutorial at: http://www.hummingbirdkit.com/learning/arduino-programming

The Hummingbird folder contains the library and example files. Hummingbird.zip is a zipped version of the library.

For the Hummingbird Duo to function properly in the Arduino environment, the board type also needs to be added. The "hardware" folder contains the configuration and definition files for a Hummingbird Duo for Arduino 1.6.0 and later. The "hardware-1.0.6\_or\_Older" folder contains this information for older versions of the Arduino IDE.

Finally, on Windows you must install the Hummingbird Duo device drivers located in the WindowsDrivers folder.

A simple way to install everything by running a single program can be found at: http://www.hummingbirdkit.com/learning/setting-arduino-environment-hummingbird-duo
